	<p>Hello! I am Riseley, call me Rise, I insist. :)<p>
	
	<p>I am another wild international student studying in Japan. I am currently studying in Hokkaido. I study Computer Science, with a focus on robotics and artificial intelligence. I am a Ritual Atheist, I believe in a world without money, a free world for all, an equal world for everyone. I also believe in living forever, yes, you heard me right, I do not plan to die, forever. Good thing is I am 21 now, so I guess I am qualified to say "Forever 21~"?<p>
