	<p>Hello! I am Riseley, call me Rise, I insist. :)<p>
	
	<p>I am another wild international student studying in Japan. I am currently studying in Hokkaido. I study Computer Science, with a focus on robotics and artificial intelligence. I am a Ritual Atheist, I believe in a world without money, a free world for all, an equal world for everyone. I also believe in living forever, yes, you heard me right, I do not plan to die, forever. Good thing is I am 21 now, so I guess I am qualified to say "Forever 21~"?<p>

	<h2>Experience</h2>
	<h3>Worked at Nuclear Science Research Center</h3>
	<p>When I was working the NSRC, a very famous and prominent physicist said, "A few decades ago, our institute, KEK and CERN needed a way to exchange information. After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">TimBL</a> created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">www</a>, I am others set up the first global internet server in the world, and hence the Internet age started! And nowadays young men use it to watch porn.", and he laughed... I was speechless.</p>
	<p>Of course, I have also worked as a software developer, magician and illusionist, fengshui guru (I am not joking), fortune teller, jack-of-all-trades slave-like manager of a coffee shop and also as a private tutor. But let's forget about them...</p>
