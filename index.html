	<h1>Welcome to Riseley's Personal Website!</h1>
	<p>Gratz! you found my secret personal website! This will be my temporary personal website with a little <em> spices*</em>. Haha.</p>
	<p>It will not be professional, it will hold my personal stuffs as well as some of my projects. Currently, it only holds front-end web designing stuffs. I plan to let it host web applications to show off some beautiful datas like those in <a href="www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful">/r/dataisbeautiful</a>, but by then it will be 2017, hahaha. I am currently focusing on other subjects other than the internet stuffs.</p>
	<p><a href="/about">You can learn more about me from the About page...</a></p>
	<li>In the future, this website will be separated into a private blog and a public portfolio.</li>
	<li>#This website is under construction. Hey, I just created this site yesterday!</li>
