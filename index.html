	<h1>Welcome to Riseley's Personal Website!</h1>
	<p>This will be my personal website with a little <em> spices*</em>. Haha.</p>
	<p>It will not be professional, it will holds my stuffs as well as some of my projects to show off. Currently, it only holds front-end web designing stuffs. I plan to let it host web applications to show off some beautiful datas like those in <a href="www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful">/r/dataisbeautiful</a>. But that will be in 2017, hahaha. I am currently focusing on other subjects other than the internet stuffs.</p>
	<p><a href="/about">You can learn more about me from the About page...</a></p>
	<li>#This website is under construction. Hey, I just created this site yesterday!</li>
